# Processes
The Poisson process is the most commonly used point process in modelling counting
phenomena. Even if the counting process has non-stationary increments, it can be
shown to converge to the Poisson process if observed sufficiently long after a transient
period as long as it constitutes a renewal process. As such, it is important to review
the key characteristics of the Poisson process as it serves as the main building block of
more complex models.
